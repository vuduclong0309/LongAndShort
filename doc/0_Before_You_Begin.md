# Before You Begin 

--- 
## Overview
This document is a preview of how my guide would be styled,
some of my design consideration (for this guide series), and 
some of preparation steps I did before starting this project, which might 
also help you.

## How should you read this guide
So, welcome to the show! 

At first I was intend for the guide to be 
very thorough, literally from A-Z, as I want this to be different from
normal online articles, which often only cover a certain aspects.

However, I realized if I do this, even I would have trouble reading through
a wall of text, and I know the exciting feeling to rush to see final product.
Moreover, I saw that there were already incredible useful knowledge archive online.

Nonetheless, there should be a minimum safety to proceed. Thus, I decided
to balance the aspects. With all things considered, here how I would write the guide:

* The guide would be splitted into multiple file, labelled numerically as the order that you should read
	*	This guide is number 0, so next step you should read guide 1

* The guide would be "dummies" style, as short as I can permit without neglecting critical point, with reference to extra research for who want detailed information
	*	I would often point to references, with a very brief summary of critical point that I learned from it
	*	A few guide / portion I would listed as skippable, but you should only skip it if you don't understand
		* Later on, when you have more knowledge from research of your own or maybe hitting understanding roadblock, reread the skipped part

## Some preparation that may help before you start (skippable)
### To prepare to be a trader:
For an absolute basic, I can't recommend you better to start with the book
TRADING FOR A LIVING (BY DR ALEXANDER ELDER)
* This would help you prepare the absolute basic for trading:
	* Psychology
	* Market analysis
	* Money management

There an also a bite-sized summary overhere https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxjlKDCEGHs

I have read the audiobook version and I recommend it, here's some key point I recalled.
* There's always a play, but limited money. 
	* Your only advantage vs trade firm is that you can decide not to play
	* Trade to survive first, only think about profit after that
* Journal your feeling to review and keep improving.
* Discipline win the game, play like you're a casino:
	* Set your own game, stick to the game that you find to have advantage.

## To prepare to be an engineer:
Well.. technically you don't need this to try the project but just to be thorough:
	
* A basic understanding of Git would help you fork this repo and develop your own bot
	* There a cheatsheet here: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
		* What you should know: Branches, Tree, Commit, Fork, Push, Merge, Commit, Pull Request
	* Reference Manual: https://git-scm.com/docs

* You can learn about AGILE software development life cycle & Atlassian tools
	* This is the principle I stick and used for my full LongNShort version

## Extra: Technical Analysis book
* As so you know, we would need a strategy to build the bot. Thus, I also have include a compilation
* of Technical Analysis technique in the file 0_Technical_Analysis.pdf that I have collected from an unknown author during my expedition
