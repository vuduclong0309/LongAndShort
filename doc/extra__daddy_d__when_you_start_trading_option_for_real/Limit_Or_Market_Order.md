## Type of order
When should you use a Market order and when should you use a Limit order?

This is going to be geared towards SPY only and should not be utilized in other stocks or etf options. 

In general you will here many many traders say "NEVER use a Market Order." But they will never give you a rationale reasoning why. Or they just say some blanket statement "You are throwing money away, or leaving money on the table."

Are you though? Is market orders as taboo as they sound? For day trading SPY options I would say absolutely not and heres why. 

Lets take a look at a few different SPY option spreads first (numbers with market closed)

1 DTE Put- Bid= 1.27, Ask= 1.30, Spread= 0.03

7 DTE put- Bid= 2.90, Ask= $2.94, Spread= 0.04

14 DTE Put- Bid= 7.24, Ask= 7.28, Spread= 0.04

30 DTE Put- Bid= 11.7, Ask= 11.75, Spread= 0.05

As you can see the further DTE we get the wider the spread gets. Also big note here is that I am drawing these numbers at market close and arguably as far as they ever are apart. Intraday I will say 75% if not more of the time 1-7 DTE options are a 0.01 Spread. 

Okay so how much money are we leaving on the table?

Lets utilize $10,000 for this example.

Lets buy the 7 DTE Put. $10,000 / $294 (2.94 bid x 100) = 34 Contracts or $9,996

Okay now lets say market moves 10% like we want it to... 

Premiums are now Bid= 3.19, Ask= 3.23 (0.04 spread still). 

If you executed a MARKET order you generally get filled with the lowest price which is the Bid here so 3.19. 

So 3.19 x 34 contracts=  a nice profit of $10,846

Now if you executed a LIMIT order for the 10% of the ASK at 3.23 you net a profit of= $10,982.

A difference of $136. 

So yes of course the more capital you spend per trade and the further the spread (SPY is very rarely more than 0.03 to 0.05 from what I have seen) the more you "lose." 

But let me share a couple of real world examples that may make you rethink that tiny $136.
These are all things that I have done and all reasons why I almost always utilize MARKET orders when BUYING and sometimes when selling. 

Heres the scenario: As you know I base my trading on momentum and support/ resistance lines. When we enter a trade we are entering as it is breaking the trend line which usually generates a pretty big move. Lets say dead at support is 3.0 premium. You have your limit order set ready to push BUY when it breaks support. so you set your limit order to 3.05 to leave a little room. Okay now it breaks the support and drops like a rock... BOOM premium is already at 3.50 and guess who didnt get filled? You. Now you are fumbling around adjusting your limit order for 3.5. Then boom spy makes another big move down with momentum. Premium is now 3.7 and you still havent gotten filled. 
You have now effectively missed a spread of 0.5 and 0.2 for a total of 0.7 because of your limit order. 

3.0 premium --> 3.5 premium= 15%
3.5 premium --> 3.7= 5.5% 
3.0 --> 3.7 premium= 19% 

So while you attempted to fill a limit order at the bid you just missed out on a huge 19% profit. When you could have executed a market order at 3.0 when it dropped and most likely gotten filled somewhere between 3.1 to 3.2 on the dip. 

This scenario has happened to me more times than I can count. Ready for the big move and I miss it because my limit order doesnt get filled. Now instead of a 10% move you need a 29% move on the premium to get your 10% profits for the day. Kinda crazy huh?

Now apply this to exiting the trade. Say you are at 40% profits and you are ready to exit so you put in your LIMIT order for 40%.... oops spy just found a support bounce and guess whos left hanging? you are... 

Now say you put a MARKET sell in at 40% but SPY catches a big bounce... guess who probably got filled between 30-35% profits... you did. 

With high volatility intraday market orders are preferred.
