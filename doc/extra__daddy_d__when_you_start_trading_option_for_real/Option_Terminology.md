# Option Terminology

## Author's Note
Mandatory Disclaimer: This is a post from DaddyD, I only rearranged it and include it here as I see this is a relevant topic

## CALL OPTION
A call option gives the buyer the right to buy 100 shares at a fixed price (strike price) before a specified date (expiration date). Likewise, the seller (writer) of a call option is obligated to sell the stock at the strike price if the option is exercised.

## PUT OPTION
A put option gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares at a fixed price (strike price) before a specified date (expiration date). Likewise, the seller (writer) of a put option is obligated to purchase the stock at the strike price if exercised.

## STRIKE (OR EXERCISE) PRICE
The strike price is the price per share at which the holder can purchase (for call options) or sell (for put options) the underlying stock.

## EXERCISE
Exercise is the process by which an option buyer (holder) invokes the terms of the option contract. If exercising, calls will buy the underlying stock, while put owners will sell the underlying stock under the terms set by the option contract. All option contracts that are in-the-money (i.e. have at least one cent of intrinsic value) at expiration will be automatically exercised.

## EXPIRATION DATE
The expiration date is the last day on which the option may be exercised. Monthly listed stock options cease trading on the third Friday of each month and expire the next day. Weekly options cease trading on Friday of that week..

## HEDGING
Hedging is a conservative strategy used to reduce investment risk by implementing a transaction that offsets an existing position.

## COVERED CALL
A covered call is a call option that is written (sold) against an existing stock position. The call is said to be “covered” by the underlying stock, which could be delivered if the call option is exercised.

## INTRINSIC VALUE
The intrinsic value of an option is the amount of profit that can be theoretically obtained if the option is exercised at that moment and the stock either purchased (for calls) or sold (for puts) at the current market price. If an option has positive intrinsic value, it is said to be “in-the-money” (ITM) and if it has negative intrinsic value it is said to be “out-of-the-money” (OTM). For instance an XYZ January 25 Call would have $1.50 of intrinsic value if the stock were trading at $26.50, regardless of its market price at the time.

## TIME VALUE
Time value is the amount by which an option’s market price exceeds its intrinsic value. In the case above with the XYZ January 25 Call priced at $3.00 while XYZ stock is trading at $26.50, the intrinsic value is $1.50 and the remaining $1.50 is time value. If an option is out-of-the-money (i.e. has no intrinsic value) then the entire market price is considered time value.

## PREMIUM
The price of an option is called its premium. Prices are quoted per share, but premium is usually the entire dollar value of the contract (price per share X 100 shares = total premium).

## TIME DECAY
Because options have an expiration date, all options are wasting assets whose time value erodes to zero by expiration. This erosion is known as time decay. Time value varies with the square root of time, so that as an option approaches its expiration date, the rate of time decay increases.

## LONG
To be “long” an option simply means to have purchased it in an opening transaction and thus to own or hold it.

## SHORT
To be short an option means to have sold the option in an opening transaction. (A short position is carried as a negative on a statement and must be purchased later to close out.)

## In-The-Money (ITM)
For call options, this means the stock price is above the strike price. So if a call has a strike price of $50 and the stock is trading at $55, that option is in-the-money.

For put options, it means the stock price is below the strike price. So if a put has a strike price of $50 and the stock is trading at $45, that option is in-the-money.

This term might also remind you of a great song from the 1930s that you can tap dance to whenever your option strategies go according to plan.

## Out-of-The-Money (OTM)

For call options, this means the stock price is below the strike price. For put options, this means the stock price is above the strike price. The price of out-of-the-money options consists entirely of “time value.”

## At-The-Money (ATM)
An option is “at-the-money” when the stock price is equal to the strike price. (Since the two values are rarely exactly equal, when purchasing options the strike price closest to the stock price is typically called the “ATM strike.”)



## Assignment
When the writer of a contract is required to fulfill their obligations under the terms of that contract – for example buying the underlying security if they have written calls or selling the underlying security if they have written puts. The writer will be issued with an assignment notice in such circumstances.

## Bid / Ask Price
Ask Price: The price it costs to buy an option.

Bid Price: The price at which an option can be sold.

## Bid Ask Spread

The difference between the bid price and the ask price of an option. An indicator of liquidity, and often referred to simply as the spread.

## Implied Volatility

Often abbreviated to IV, it's a measure of the estimated volatility of the price a financial instrument at the current time. Read more about Volatility and Implied Volatility.

## Open Interest
A measurement of the total number of open positions relating to a particular option.
