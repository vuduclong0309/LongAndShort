## Which type of Account?
"How are you avoiding PDT rules trading everyday?"

Its actually quite simple and something I swear no broker or person ever truly explains properly. 

PDT was established long ago to "protect" retail from themselves basically. 
Its a real inconvience but nonetheless we have a way around it. 

If you have >25k I actually highly recommend a margin account as it allows you to trade options multiple times a day and you do not have to wait for settled funds. 

With Margin if you have >25k at the START of the trading day (930a) then you are not bound to PDT. 

So if your end of market (8pm day before) exceeds that 25k you are good to go. This DOES NOT have to be cash. You can have some in options, shares, or cash. Essentially your total net liquid value at 8pm the night before needs to be >25k and then PDT does not apply to you.
