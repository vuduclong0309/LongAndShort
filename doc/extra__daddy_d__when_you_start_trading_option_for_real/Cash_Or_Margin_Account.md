# Picking A Brokerage

## Author's Note
Mandatory Disclaimer: This is a post from DaddyD, I only rearranged it and include it here as I see this is a relevant topic

Technically I suggested you to use IBKR since it's the platform that the bot is working on. But hey,
you might want to trade in your own way, so this post might help if you are consider another brokerage

## Choosing A Brokerage
There are a plethora of brokerages out there so how do you figure out which one is the best for you?

Well you have to ask yourself what you need out of a brokerage? 

Do you need the fastest fills? Do you need an easy UI? 

Do you need a better desktop vs. mobile platform? Do you need built in charts? What do YOU need?

I have used quite a few brokerages over the years and I will touch on them all and then explain why I use TDA/ TOS now and what my thoughts are on others.

### Vanguard
Arguably besides Fidelity one of the safest places to park your money. However, for options this is no bueno. Their mobile app feels like the 90s all over again. If you are looking for a user friendly place this is not it. If you need a safe place to park a lot of money and know in 30-50 years itll be there... this is your guy.

### Fidelity
Another very safe choice if you want to make sure your money will never dissappear. Now Fidelity does have a new beta app out that actually isnt too bad. However, having used it for a few months it is very slow to get in and out of positions. It takes up to 30 seconds sometimes as you have to click through about 10 screens to buy or sell anything. Their Trader Desk Pro or whatever it is called is actually a pretty cool UI that you can customize very well. However, I had NUMEROUS times where I would go to sell my positions and get an error. I would then have to quickly log into mobile to sell and by time that happened it was redder than red. Its not one i recommend. However, I keep my IRA here and once I start getting a large portfolio all my extra profits and money for safety will be kept here. I will say the one nice thing is you can immediately trade with your deposits and cash withdrawls are same day most times. Like i said good for long term not good for day trading.

### Robinhood
This is arguably the most popular app out there. I have never traded options on here myself but have looked at their chains a few times and obviously see screenshots everyday. I really like how robinhood shows your p/l and there ability to quickly buy an option is nice. however, they are an apex holding which means they essentially source your money to another clearinghouse. I dont like that and i dont trust it. Yes there is some people with millions on this app and i would never ever do that. 

### Webull
I actually overall really love webull. Their charts are the best of all apps (besides trading view), their interface for options chains are super great too (though sometimes ive noticed a lag in premium prices). I havent bought a option on their but used to do shares a lot on there and their overall system is super great. The only real reason i dont use webull is because of their apex clearinghouse also. Webull does have a fairly nice and user friendly desktop app i really enjoyed using too. 

### TDA/ TOS
This is where i ended up putting all my option investment money and for the forseeable future will keep it. The one nice thing i have noticed about TDA/ TOS is you are getting 2 apps in one. You can use either Ameritrades or think or swim depending on how you are feelling. I have found on mobile i can get into an options trade on TDA very quickly and its super clear what i am buying and it calculates exactly how much the total trade costs which is a huge benefit. TOS is the best for getting out of a trade quickly and for watching your P/L as it is super clean and simple which i love. TOS is the only desktop app as TDA doesnt have one (does have a webpage though). I am not really a huge fan of the TOS desktop as i feel it lacks compared to the mobile. I do however use it to monitor my positions but always buy/ sell on mobile.
