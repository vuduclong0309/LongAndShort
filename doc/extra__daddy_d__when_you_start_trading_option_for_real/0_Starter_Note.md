# Starter Note

--- 
## Overview
So... after you checked all of the stuff, and wanted to continue to trading in real time.

This folder contain some of the stuff that I considered good to know at the start, as a trader.

The following guides is more or less borrowed from DaddyD - a cool SPY option trader I've met online -
who has a nice series a post that I thought provide great information when you started trading.

## How should you read this folder
As I mentioned above, as the original document is a series of post on the channel, there is no order of preference
in reading. Each document will be self-contained and cover a topic that you might encounter during your setup.

Good luck!
