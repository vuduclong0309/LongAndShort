## Position Scaling?
For many of you this is a new method you may not be used to and for some options are a completely new ball game.

So the question is how do you scale? How do you choose what % of your portfolio to allocate to options each week?

The general rule of thumb is 10%. So if you have a 10k account... 1k/ week allocated to options would be sufficient. 

For some you may say why cant I just use the 10k and increase my portfolio faster? Well you COULD but doing so would mean you are also risking the chance of your whole portfolio dipping 10-20% in one day if you are wrong or get a bad break...

It is much safer and efficient to use 10% and go from there. Remember we are NOT trying to get rich over night, we are trying to every day make consistent gains to grow it exponentially over a year. 

Think about this... if you start with 1k in your first week if you make 5 trades using the 1k + profits end of the week you will have $1600. do that for 20 weeks and you just double your account and now you can use 2k per week.... you see if we are patient and consistent we can grow our accounts incredibly fast and with a calculated risk.T does not apply to you.
