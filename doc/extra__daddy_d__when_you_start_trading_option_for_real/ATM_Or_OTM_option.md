If you are confused of ATM and OTM option, you may refer to Option Terminology

## Choosing the option
The reason i choose to do ATM is because of cost and risk tolerance. I also prefer 3-7 DTE with really 5 DTE being the sweet spot. Overall when a 5 DTE and ATM option you only need be right for about $1 and youll net easily 10% and same thing if you are $1 wrong you will be able to get out for less then 10% loss. For instance today mid day i bought a 7DTE put and held it for almost half the day and i was wrong for quite a while but i never saw more than 10% negative.
Had i held a 0dte i would have easily been down 50%... with a 0DTE ATM if you are $1 wrong you are already down minimum of 25%. 

A 0dte give you VERY little room. If you are 1000% confident in your position a 0dte can work but they are so risky and they move so far right or wrong. You can watch a 0 dte go green 25% and see a small pullback and red before you can even blink. 

The further out you go the more room you have. The further DTE is more important than the actual strike. threfore if you can not afford an ATM 5 DTE option it is BETTER to go further OTM to buy in rather then going less DTE to be "cheaper" the same STRIKE ATM and 5 OTM option will move within reason of eachother with a bout a 2% +/-  difference. 

a 3DTE option ATM will net you slightly more for a $1 move but will also net you slightly more red at about 15% with a $1 more either way. 

So if you had to chose i would always say 5DTE ATM option is the best choice for MOST people especially those who struggle with good entries. If you are very confident a 3 DTE is a good option too but you will need to be much more careful with your stop loss.
